To compile the code, you can download SublimeText3 and simply open the "Physics 2D Platformer SDL.sublime-workspace" file.
This file already has all the configurations to set SublimeText as an IDE, and within the "Physics 2D Platformer SDL.sublime-project" 
file, there is a json with all of the information the compiler need to link the src code with the SDL library, and the dll files is all within the debug folder, in which the game will be compiled. All you need to do is download the SDL library and SDL_Mixer.

You can follow this tutorial to see how to link SDL extesion libraries with the src code of the game: https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/06_extension_libraries_and_loading_other_image_formats/index.php
