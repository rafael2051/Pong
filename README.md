To compile the code, you can download SublimeText3 and simply open the "Physics 2D Platformer SDL.sublime-workspace" file.
This file already has all the configurations to set SublimeText as an IDE, and within the "Physics 2D Platformer SDL.sublime-project" 
file, there is a json with all of the information the compiler need to link the src code with the SDL library. All you need to do is download
the SDL library and SDL_Mixer.
